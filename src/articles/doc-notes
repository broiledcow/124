List of notes to myself about choices I'm making with regards to article formats and stuff

BIG NOTES:
    image size doesn't matter, the percentage thingy automatically makes it work. but keep
    file size down. in the kb range. 

    because "bullshit", the only way to link releases to artist pages is to put the artist's
    name in the tags on the release markdown file. 



For ARTIST ARTICLES tags
---
name: the artist's name
    note to self: the NAME field is incredibly important. capitalization does not matter,
    but everything else must be exact. 
genre: 
    - format
    - like
    - this
yearsActive:
    - format
    - like
    - 1990s
    - [by decade]
thumb: 
    this field doesn't actually exist. there's a hardcoded image link on the artistArticle 
    template. ex, "the-cleaners-from-venus.png". except the actual band name is autogenerated
    from whatever name we put in the name field, so they MUST match and stay consistent
imageAlt: standard image alt, put, because it's nice to be nice

tags: none, but some are inherited from the folder, "article" and "artistArticle" or "releaseArticle"
