List of notes to myself about choices I'm making with regards to article formats and stuff

BIG NOTES:
    image size doesn't matter, the percentage thingy automatically makes it work. but keep
    file size down. in the kb range. 



For ARTIST ARTICLES tags
---
name: the artist's name
    note to self: the NAME field is incredibly important. capitalization does not matter,
    but everything else must be exact. 
genre: 
    - format
    - like
    - this
yearsActive:
    - format
    - like
    - 1990s
    - [by decade]
thumb: 
    this field doesn't actually exist. there's a hardcoded image link on the artistArticle 
    template. ex, "the-cleaners-from-venus.png". except the actual band name is autogenerated
    from whatever name we put in the name field, so they MUST match and stay consistent
imageAlt: standard image alt, put, because it's nice to be nice
description: not using this for now
tags: none, but some are inherited from the folder, "article" and "artistArticle" or "releaseArticle"
