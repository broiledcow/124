<mark>Blow Away Your Troubles</mark> is the debut album by British Indie Rock band <mark>The Cleaners From Venus</mark>.



##### History

In 1980, <mark>Martin Newell</mark> released the single <mark>"Young Jobless"</mark>, a song criticizing the government's role in widespread unemployment. The single was met with controversy when it was discovered that- through some convoluted chain- the funding for the recording had come from the government itself. Unhappy with his fleeting experience as a signed artist, Newell began playing music with friend <mark>Lawrence Elliot</mark>.



The recording process of Blow Away Your Troubles was horrifyingly primitive, even by the standards of the day. Using a homemade bass, the lid of a beer-brewing kit for a snare, and recorded on a mono tape recorder in an abandoned kitchen, it's a wonder these songs ended up listenable, much less the catchy pop gems they are.







##### Track Listing Weirdness/ Lost and Obscure Songs 


The release process was equally confused- lacking any set track listing, early batches of *Blow Away Your Troubles* consisted of whatever tracks Lawrence Elliot felt like including at the time, though this eventually was solidified into a static lineup \[featured in the sidebar]. 



In 2012, Captured Tracks released a special vinyl edition of *Blow Away Your Troubles*, dropping "Change Change Change" and "Hey Dreamer", replacing them with "The Trevor Rutter Experience", "A Weekend In Subordia", and "The Artichoke That Loved Me", which were not present on the original "finalized" lineup.

<p>Martin Newell has stated that there were 40 songs recorded for <i>Blow Away Your Troubles</i>. Given the miniscule number of
    copies made, most songs not included on the Captured Tracks reissue are hard to find or simply lost. 
    <br><br>
    Here is a list of all songs not officially accessible as of the writing of this article. I've included the audio for ones I've been able to get my hands on, as well as polishing up the audio a bit.

    <mark>"Canon" songs</mark>
    <br><a target="_blank" href="/assets/audio/changechangechange.mp3">Change Change Change</a>
    <br><a target="_blank" href="/assets/audio/heydreamer.mp3">Hey Dreamer</a>
    <br><br><mark>"Noncanonical" songs</mark>
    <br>Look At The Wall
    <br>The Meltdown Watutsi [Copy in posession of Lawrence Elliot]
    <br><a target="_blank" href="/assets/audio/unknowncleanersfromvenussong.mp3">"Too Sick for Kissing?" - Partial [really good too]</a>

    This leaves 15 ish songs as lost media.
